### Smart Cities Master's Degree Data Repository

Welcome to the data repository for my Master's Degree in Smart Cities at Universidad Complutense Madrid.

#### Purpose

This repository is created to share different datasets utilized during my Master's Degree program. Public data often proves to be complex to work with, and by providing the datasets along with code snippets, I aim to simplify the process for fellow researchers and enthusiasts.

#### Data Sources

All data shared here is public, and links to the respective sources will be included for easy access.

#### Code Comments

Throughout the code, comments will be added to clarify the intention and the scope of the work. This will enhance understanding for those exploring the datasets and codebase.
